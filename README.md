# Dedupe Python Library

_dedupe is a python library that uses machine learning to perform de-duplication and entity resolution quickly on structured data._

__dedupe__ will help you: 

* __remove duplicate entries__ from a spreadsheet of names and addresses
* __link a list__ with customer information to another with order history, even without unique customer id's
* take a database of campaign contributions and __figure out which ones were made by the same person__, even if the names were entered slightly differently for each record

dedupe takes in human training data and comes up with the best rules for your dataset to quickly and automatically find similar records, even with very large databases.

## Tools built with dedupe

### [csvdedupe](https://github.com/datamade/csvdedupe)
Command line tool for de-duplicating and [linking](https://github.com/datamade/csvdedupe#csvlink-usage) CSV files. Read about it on [Source Knight-Mozilla OpenNews](https://source.opennews.org/en-US/articles/introducing-cvsdedupe/).

###[Spreadsheet Deduper](http://dedupe.datamade.us/)
Web interface for de-duplicating spreadsheets with up to 10,000 rows. Read about it on the [DataMade blog](http://datamade.us/blog/introducing-spreadsheet-deduper/).

## Installation

### Users

If you only want to use dedupe, install it this way:

```bash
pip install "numpy>=1.6"
pip install dedupe
```

### Developers

Dedupe requires [numpy](http://numpy.scipy.org/), which can be complicated to install. 
If you are installing numpy for the first time, 
[follow these instructions](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/install.html). You'll need to version 1.6 of numpy or higher.

```bash
git clone git://github.com/datamade/dedupe.git
cd dedupe
pip install "numpy>=1.6"
pip install -r dev_requirements.txt
# For python 2.7
pip install -r requirements.txt
# For python 2.6
pip install -r py26_requirements.txt

cython src/*.pyx
python setup.py develop

#If these tests pass, then everything should have been installed correctly!
coverage run -m nose -I canonical_test
```

#### OS X Install Notes

Before installing, you may need to set the following environmental
variables from the command line 

```bash 
export CFLAGS=-Qunused-arguments 
export CPPFLAGS=-Qunused-arguments
```

With default configurations, dedupe cannot do parallel processing on Mac OS X.
For more information and for instructions on how to enable this, [refer to the
wiki](http://dedupe.readthedocs.org/en/latest/OSX-Install-Notes.html).

## Testing
