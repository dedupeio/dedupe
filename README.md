# Dedupe Python Library
A free python library for accurate and scaleable deduplication and entity-resolution. 

[<img src="https://travis-ci.org/open-city/dedupe.png" />](https://travis-ci.org/open-city/dedupe)

Based on Mikhail Yuryevich Bilenko's Ph. D dissertation: Learnable Similarity Functions and their Application to Record Linkage and Clustering

Current solutions break easily, donâ€™t scale, and require significant developer time. Our solution is robust, can handle a large volume of data, and can be trained by anyone.

## Python Dependencies

* [numpy](http://numpy.scipy.org/)
* [fastcluster](http://math.stanford.edu/~muellner/fastcluster.html)
* [hcluster](http://code.google.com/p/scipy-cluster/)
* [networkx](http://networkx.github.com/)

## Usage
```bash
python setup.py install
python examples/csv_example.py
```
  (use 'y', 'n' and 'u' keys to flag duplicates for active learning, 'f' when you are finished) 

## Testing

Unit tests of core dedupe functions
```bash
python test/test_dedupe.py
```

Test using canonical dataset from Bilenko's research
  
Using random sample data for training
```bash
python test/canonical_test.py
```

Using active learning for training
```bash
python test/canonical_test.py --active True
```
