"""
This code demonstrates how to use dedupe with a comma separated values
(CSV) file. All operations are performed in memory, so will run very
quickly on datasets up to ~10,000 rows.

We start with a CSV file containing our messy data. In this example,
it is listings of early childhood education centers in Chicago
compiled from several different sources.

The output will be a CSV with our clustered results.

For larger datasets, see our [mysql_example](http://open-city.github.com/dedupe/doc/mysql_example.html)
