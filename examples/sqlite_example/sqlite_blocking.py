"""
This is an example of working with very large data. There are about
700,000 unduplicated donors in this database of Illinois political
campaign contributions.

While we might be able to keep these donor records in memory, we
cannot possibly store all the comparison pairs we will make.

Because of performance issues that we are still working through, this
example is broken into two files, sqlite_blocking.py which blocks the
data, sqlite_clustering.py which clusters the blocked data.
