Variable Definitions
====================

Variable Types
--------------

A variable definition describes the records that you want to match. It is
a dictionary where the keys are the fields and the values are the
field specification. For example:-

.. code:: python

    [
        {'field': 'Site name', 'type': 'String'},
        {'field': 'Address', 'type': 'String'},
        {'field': 'Zip', 'type': 'String', 'has missing': True},
        {'field': 'Phone', 'type': 'String', 'has missing': True}
    ]


String Types
^^^^^^^^^^^^

A ``String`` type field must declare the name of the record field to compare
a ``String`` type declaration. The ``String`` type expects fields to be of
class string.

``String`` types are compared using `affine gap string
distance <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gap_penalty#Affine>`__.

For example:-

.. code:: python

  {'field': 'Address', type: 'String'}

ShortString Types
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A ``ShortString`` type field is just like ``String`` types except that dedupe
will not try to learn a canopy blocking rule for these fields, which can
speed up the training phase considerably.

Zip codes and city names are good candidates for this type. If in doubt,
always use ``String``.

For example:-

.. code:: python

  {'field': 'Zipcode', type: 'ShortString'}

.. _text-types-label:

Text Types
^^^^^^^^^^

If you want to compare fields containing long blocks of text e.g. product
descriptions or article abstracts, you should use this type. ``Text`` type
fields are compared using the `cosine similarity metric
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space_model>`__.

This is a measurement of the amount of words that two documents have in
common. This measure can be made more useful as the overlap of rare words
counts more than the overlap of common words.

If provided a sequence of example fields (i.e. a corpus) then dedupe will
learn these weights for you. For example:-

.. code:: python

   {
    'field': 'Product description',
    'type': 'Text', 
    'corpus' : [
            'this product is great',
            'this product is great and blue'
        ]
   } 

If you don't want to adjust the measure to your data, just leave 'corpus' out
of the variable definition entirely.

.. code:: python

   {'field': 'Product description', 'type': 'Text'} 


Custom Types
^^^^^^^^^^^^

A ``Custom`` type field must have specify the field it wants to compare, a
type declaration of ``Custom``, and a comparator declaration. The comparator
must be a function that can take in two field values and return a number.

For example, a custom comparator:

.. code:: python

  def sameOrNotComparator(field_1, field_2) :     
    if field_1 and field_2 :         
        if field_1 == field_2 :             
            return 1         
        else:             
            return 0     

The corresponding variable definition:

.. code:: python

    {
        'field': 'Zip',
        'type': 'Custom', 
        'comparator': sameOrNotComparator
     } 

LatLong
^^^^^^^

A ``LatLong`` type field must have as the name of a field and a type
declaration of ``LatLong``. ``LatLong`` fields are compared using the `Haversine
Formula <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula>`__. 

A ``LatLong``
type field must consist of tuples of floats corresponding to a latitude and a
longitude.

.. code:: python

    {'field': 'Location', 'type': 'LatLong'}

Set
^^^

A ``Set`` type field is for comparing lists of elements, like keywords or
client names. ``Set`` types are very similar to :ref:`text-types-label`. They
use the same comparison function and you can also let dedupe learn which
terms are common or rare by providing a corpus. Within a record, a ``Set``
type field has to be hashable sequences like tuples or frozensets.

.. code:: python

    {
        'field': 'Co-authors',
        'type': 'Set',
        'corpus' : [
                ('steve edwards'),
                ('steve edwards', 'steve jobs')
            ]
     } 

or

.. code:: python

    {'field': 'Co-authors', 'type': 'Set'}

Interaction
^^^^^^^^^^^

An ``Interaction`` field multiplies the values of the multiple variables.
An ``Interaction`` variable is created with type declaration of
``Interaction`` and an ``interaction variables`` declaration.

The ``interaction variables`` field must be a sequence of variable names of
other fields you have defined in your variable definition.

`Interactions <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction_%28statistics%29>`__
are good when the effect of two predictors is not simply additive.

.. code:: python

    [
        { 'field': 'Name', 'variable name': 'name', 'type': 'String' },
        { 'field': 'Zip', 'variable name': 'zip', 'type': 'Custom', 
      'comparator' : sameOrNotComparator },
        {'type': 'Interaction', 'interaction variables': ['name', 'zip']}
    ]

Exact
^^^^^

``Exact`` variables measure whether two fields are exactly the same or not.

.. code:: python

    {'field': 'city', 'type': 'Exact'}


Exists
^^^^^^

``Exists`` variables measure whether both, one, or neither of the fields are
defined. This can be useful if the presence or absence of a field tells you
something meaningful about the record.

.. code:: python

    {'field': 'first_name', 'type': 'Exists'} 



Categorical
^^^^^^^^^^^

``Categorical`` variables are useful when you are dealing with qualitatively
different types of things. For example, you may have data on businesses and
you find that taxi cab businesses tend to have very similar names but law
firms don't. ``Categorical`` variables would let you indicate whether two records
are both taxi companies, both law firms, or one of each.

Dedupe would represent these three possibilities using two dummy variables:

::

    taxi-taxi      0 0
    lawyer-lawyer  1 0
    taxi-lawyer    0 1

A categorical field declaration must include a list of all the different
strings that you want to treat as different categories.

So if you data looks like this:-

::

    'Name'          'Business Type' 
    AAA Taxi        taxi 
    AA1 Taxi        taxi 
    Hindelbert Esq  lawyer

You would create a definition such as:

.. code:: python

    {
        'field': 'Business Type',
        'type': 'Categorical',
        'categories' : ['taxi', 'lawyer']
    }

Price
^^^^^

``Price`` variables are useful for comparing positive, non-zero numbers like
prices. The values of ``Price`` field must be a positive float. If the value is
0 or negative, then an exception will be raised.

.. code:: python

    {'field': 'cost', 'type': 'Price'}

DateTime
^^^^^^^^

``DateTime`` variables are useful for comparing dates and timestamps. This
variable can accept strings or Python datetime objects as inputs.

The ``DateTime`` variable definition accepts a few optional arguments that
can help improve behavior if you know your field follows an unusual format:

* :code:`fuzzy` - Use fuzzy parsing to automatically extract dates from strings like "It happened on June 2nd, 2018" (default :code:`True`)
* :code:`dayfirst` - Ambiguous dates should be parsed as dd/mm/yy (default :code:`False`)
* :code:`yearfirst`-  Ambiguous dates should be parsed as yy/mm/dd (default :code:`False`)

Note that the ``DateTime`` variable defaults to mm/dd/yy for ambiguous dates.
If both :code:`dayfirst` and :code:`yearfirst` are set to :code:`True`, then
:code:`dayfirst` will take precedence.

For example, a sample ``DateTime`` variable definition, using the defaults:

.. code:: python

    {
        'field': 'time_of_sale',
        'type': 'DateTime',
        'fuzzy': True,
        'dayfirst': False,
        'yearfirst': False
    }

If you're happy with the defaults, you can simply define the :code:`field`
and :code:`type`:

.. code:: python

    {'field': 'time_of_sale', 'type': 'DateTime'}


Optional Variables
------------------

Address Type
^^^^^^^^^^^^

An ``Address`` variable should be used for United States addresses. It uses
the `usaddress <https://usaddress.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__ package to
split apart an address string into components like address number, street
name, and street type and compares component to component.

For example:-

.. code:: python

    {'field': 'address', 'type': 'Address'}


Install the `dedupe-variable-address
<https://pypi.python.org/pypi/dedupe-variable-address>`__ package for
``Address`` Type.

Name Type
^^^^^^^^^

A ``Name`` variable should be used for a field that contains American names,
corporations and households. It uses the `probablepeople
<https://probablepeople.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__ package to split apart
an name string into components like give name, surname, generational suffix,
for people names, and abbreviation, company type, and legal form for
corporations.

For example:-

.. code:: python

    {'field': 'name', 'type': 'Name'}


Install the `dedupe-variable-name
<https://pypi.python.org/pypi/dedupe-variable-name>`__ package for ``Name``
Type.

Fuzzy Category
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A ``FuzzyCategorical`` variable should be used for when you for
categorical data that has variations.

Occupations are an example, where the you may have 'Attorney', 'Counsel', and
'Lawyer'. For this variable type, you need to supply a corpus of records that
contain your focal record and other field types. This corpus should either be
all the data you are trying to link or a representative sample.

For example:-

.. code:: python

    {
     'field': 'occupation',
     'type': 'FuzzyCategorical',
     'corpus' : [
            {'name' : 'Jim Doe', 'occupation' : 'Attorney'},
            {'name' : 'Jim Doe', 'occupation' : 'Lawyer'}
        ]
    }

Install the `dedupe-variable-fuzzycategory
<https://pypi.python.org/pypi/dedupe-variable-fuzzycategory>`__ package for
the ``FuzzyCategorical`` Type.


Missing Data 
------------ 
If the value of field is missing, that missing value should be represented as 
a ``None`` object.

.. code:: python

   [
        {'Name': 'AA Taxi', 'Phone': '773.555.1124'},
        {'Name': 'AA Taxi', 'Phone': None},
        {'Name': None, 'Phone': '773-555-1123'}
   ]

If you want to model this missing data for a field, you can set ``'has
missing' : True`` in the variable definition. This creates a new,
additional field representing whether the data was present or not and
zeros out the missing data.

If there is missing data, but you did not declare ``'has
missing' : True`` then the missing data will simply be zeroed out and
no field will be created to account for missing data.

This approach is called 'response augmented data' and is described in
Benjamin Marlin's thesis `"Missing Data Problems in Machine Learning"
<http://people.cs.umass.edu/~marlin/research/phd_thesis/marlin-phd-thesis.pdf>`__.
Basically, this approach says that, even without looking at the value of the
field comparisons, the pattern of observed and missing responses will affect
the probability that a pair of records are a match.

This approach makes a few assumptions that are usually not completely true:

- Whether a field is missing data is not associated with any other field missing data.
- That the weighting of the observed differences in field A should be the same regardless of whether field B is missing.


If you define an an interaction with a field that you declared to have
missing data, then ``has missing : True`` will also be set for the
Interaction field.

Longer example of a variable definition:

.. code:: python

    [
        {'field': 'name', 'variable name' : 'name', 'type': 'String'},
        {'field': 'address', 'type': 'String'},
        {'field': 'city', 'variable name' : 'city', 'type': 'String'},
        {'field': 'zip', 'type': 'Custom', 'comparator' : sameOrNotComparator},
        {'field': 'cuisine', 'type': 'String', 'has missing': True}
        {'type': 'Interaction', 'interaction variables' : ['name', 'city']}
    ]

Multiple Variables comparing same field
--------------------------------------- 
It is possible to define multiple variables that all compare the same
variable.

For example:-

.. code:: python

    [
        {'field': 'name', 'type': 'String'},
        {'field': 'name', 'type': 'Text'}
    ]


Will create two variables that both compare the 'name' field but 
in different ways.


Optional Edit Distance
----------------------

For ``String``, ``ShortString``, ``Address``, and ``Name`` fields, you can
choose to use the a conditional random field distance measure for strings.
This measure can give you more accurate results but is much slower than the
default edit distance.

.. code:: python

    {'field': 'name', 'type': 'String', 'crf': True}
