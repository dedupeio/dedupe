:class:`Dedupe` Objects
--------------------------
Class for active learning deduplication. Use deduplication when you have
data that can contain multiple records that can all refer to the same
entity. 

.. py:class:: Dedupe(field_definition, [data_sample=None, [num_processes]])

   Initialize a Dedupe object with a :doc:`field definition <Field-definition>`

   :param dict field_definition: A field definition is a dictionary
				 where the keys are the fields that
				 will be used for training a model
				 and the values are the field
				 specifications 
   :param data_sample: is an optional argument that we discuss below
   :param int num_processes: the number of processes to use for parallel
			     processing, defaults to 1

   In order to learn how to deduplicate records, dedupe needs a sample
   of records you are trying to deduplicate. If your data is not too
   large (fits in memory), you can pass your data to the
   :py:meth:`~Dedupe.sample` method and dedupe will take a sample for
   you.

   .. code:: python

      # initialize from a defined set of fields
      fields = {
	        'Site name': {'type': 'String'},
		'Address': {'type': 'String'},
		'Zip': {'type': 'String', 'Has Missing':True},
		'Phone': {'type': 'String', 'Has Missing':True},
		}

      deduper = dedupe.Dedupe(fields)

      deduper.sample(your_data)

   If your data won't fit in memory, you'll have to prepare a sample
   of the data yourself and pass it to Dedupe.

   ``data_sample`` should be a sequence of tuples, where each tuple
   contains a pair of records, and each record is a dictionary-like
   object that contains the field names you declared in
   field\_definitions as keys.

   For example, a data_sample with only one pair of records,

   .. code:: python

      data_sample = [(
                      (854, {'city': 'san francisco',
	                     'address': '300 de haro st.',
		             'name': "sally's cafe & bakery",
		             'cuisine': 'american'}),
	               (855, {'city': 'san francisco',
	                      'address': '1328 18th st.',
                              'name': 'san francisco bbq',
                              'cuisine': 'thai'})
	               )
	              ]

      deduper = dedupe.Dedupe(fields, data_sample)
      
   See `MySQL
   <http://open-city.github.com/dedupe/doc/mysql_example.html>`__ for
   an example of how to create a data sample yourself.

   .. py:method:: sample(data[, sample_size=150000])

      If you did not initialize the Dedupe object with a data_sample, you
      will need to call this method to take a random sample of your data to be
      used for training.

      :param dict data: A dictionary-like object indexed by record ID
			where the values are dictionaries representing records.
      :param int sample_size: Number of record tuples to return. Defaults
			      to 150,000.

      .. code:: python

	 data_sample = deduper.sample(data_d, 150000)

:class:`StaticDedupe` Objects
-----------------------------

Class for deduplication using saved settings. If you have already
trained dedupe, you can load the saved settings with StaticDedupe.

.. py:class:: StaticDedupe(settings_file, [num_processes])

   Initialize a Dedupe object with saved settings

   :param str settings_file: a path to settings file produced from
			      the :py:meth:`Dedupe.writeSettings` of a
			      previous, active Dedupe object.
   :param int num_processes: the number of processes to use for parallel
			       processing, defaults to 1


   .. code:: python

       deduper = StaticDedupe('my_settings_file')

   .. include:: common_dedupe_methods.rst
   .. include:: common_methods.rst

:class:`RecordLink` Objects
---------------------------

Class for active learning record linkage.

Use RecordLinkMatching when you have two datasets that you want to
merge. Each dataset, individually, should contain no duplicates. A
record from the first dataset can match one and only one record from the
second dataset and vice versa. A record from the first dataset need not
match any record from the second dataset and vice versa.

For larger datasets, you will need to use the ``thresholdBlocks`` and
``matchBlocks``. This methods require you to create blocks of records.
For RecordLink, each blocks should be a pairs of dictionaries of
records. Each block consists of all the records that share a particular
predicate, as output by the blocker method of RecordLink.

Within a block, the first dictionary should consist of records from the
first dataset, with the keys being record ids and the values being the
record. The second dictionary should consist of records from the
dataset.

Example


.. code:: python

    > data_1 = {'A1' : {'name' : 'howard'}}
    > data_2 = {'B1' : {'name' : 'howie'}}
    ...
    > blocks = defaultdict(lambda : ({}, {}))
    >
    > for block_key, record_id in linker.blocker(data_1.items()) :
    >   blocks[block_key][0].update({record_id : data_1[record_id]})
    > for block_key, record_id in linker.blocker(data_2.items()) :
    >   if block_key in blocks :
    >     blocks[block_key][1].update({record_id : data_2[record_id]})
    >
    > blocked_data = blocks.values()
    > print blocked_data
    [({'A1' : {'name' : 'howard'}}, {'B1' : {'name' : 'howie'}})]


.. py:class:: RecordLink(field_definition, [data_sample=None, [num_processes]])

   Initialize a Dedupe object with a field definition

   :param dict field_definition: A field definition is a dictionary
				 where the keys are the fields that
				 will be used for training a model
				 and the values are the field
				 specification
   :param data_sample: is an optional argument that `we'll discuss fully
		       below <#wiki-sample-dedupe>`__
   :param int num_processes: the number of processes to use for parallel
			     processing, defaults to 1


   We assume that the fields you want to compare across datasets have the
   same field name.

   .. py:method:: sample(data_1, data_2, sample_size)

      Draws a random sample of combinations of records from the first and
      second datasets, and initializes active learning with this sample

      :param dict data_1: a dictionary of records from first dataset,
			  where the keys are record_ids and the
			  values are dictionaries with the keys being
			  field names.
      :param dict data_2: a dictionary of records from second dataset,
			  same form as data_1
      :param int sample_size: the size of the sample to draw

      .. code:: python

	  linker.sample(data_1, data_2, 150000)

:class:`StaticRecordLink` Objects
---------------------------------

Class for record linkage using saved settings. If you have already
trained a record linkage instance, you can load the saved settings with
StaticDedupe.

.. py:class:: StaticRecordLink(settings_file, [num_processes])

   Initialize a Dedupe object with saved settings

   :param str settings_file: a path to settings file produced from
			      the :py:meth:`RecordLink.writeSettings` of a
			      previous, active Dedupe object.
   :param int num_processes: the number of processes to use for parallel
			       processing, defaults to 1


   .. code:: python

       deduper = StaticDedupe('my_settings_file')

   .. include:: common_recordlink_methods.rst
   .. include:: common_methods.rst


Convenience Functions
---------------------

.. py:function:: consoleLabel(matcher)

   Train a matcher instance (Dedupe or RecordLink) from the command line.
   Example

   .. code:: python

      > dedupe = Dedupe(fields, data_sample)
      > dedupe.consoleLabel(dedupe)

.. py:function:: trainingDataLink(data_1, data_2, common_key[, training_size])

   Construct training data for consumption by the
   :py:meth:`RecordLink.markPairs` from already linked datasets.

   :param dict data_1: a dictionary of records from first dataset,
		       where the keys are record_ids and the
		       values are dictionaries with the keys being
		       field names.
   :param dict data_2: a dictionary of records from second dataset,
		       same form as data_1
   :param str common_key: the name of the record field that uniquely
			 identifies a match
   :param int training_size: the rough limit of the number of training examples,
			     defaults to 50000

   **Warning**

   Every match must be identified by the sharing of a common key. This
   function assumes that if two records do not share a common key then they
   are distinct records.

.. py:function:: trainingDataDedupe(data, common_key[, training_size])

   Construct training data for consumption by the
   :py:meth:`Dedupe.markPairs` from an already deduplicated dataset.

   :param dict data: a dictionary of records, where the keys are
		     record_ids and the values are dictionaries with
		     the keys being field names
   :param str common_key: the name of the record field that uniquely
			 identifies a match
   :param int training_size: the rough limit of the number of training examples,
			     defaults to 50000


   **Warning**

   Every match must be identified by the sharing of a common key. his
   function assumes that if two records do not share a common key then
   they are distinct records.
